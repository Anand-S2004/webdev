remove user.java and instead use userModel.java

figure out cookies and tokens
frontend sends request -> "doesUserPasswordExist" ->response yes? -> give it a token (for that we must define setUser) -> turn token to cookie -> whenever user requires his custom stuff (getUSer type funcction to retrieve userId from cookie)

USERMODEL not working to insert, this is causing issues in BIDMODEL and transacctions, unify user.java and usermodel.java


so once we have user signed in with a cookie, he should be able to:

    On his profile: (all the functionalities exist)
    Get all his bids with frozen status

    onClicking on a listed product he must be able to view product details (amazon like UI). // getProductById in product controller
    
    completely reconfigure bids

    seller can view all bids
    seller must be able to choose
